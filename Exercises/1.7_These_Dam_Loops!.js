// The Dinger Dam has 19 generators of multiple types. For simplicity, let’s
// say that the first 4 of these generators output 62 megawatts, and the other
// 15 output 124 megawatts. The Dam Rangers have asked you to
// design a system of two loops that turns each generator on in progression,
// and prints the new total of megawatts generated.
//
// They’d like the first loop to be a while loop handling the first 4
// generators. Then, they’d like the second loop to be a for loop that handles
// the other 15 generators. Each output line should resemble the following
// lines, with adjusted values for the currentGen and totalMW:
//
//    Generator #1 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 62 MW!
//    Generator #2 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 124 MW!
//
// Use the variables below in your solution.

var currentGen = 1;
var totalGen = 19;
var totalMW = 0;

while(currentGen <= 4) {
    totalMW = totalMW + 62
    console.log(`Generator #${currentGen} is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of ${totalMW} MW!`)
    currentGen = currentGen +1
}
    

for(currentGen; currentGen <= 19; currentGen++) {
    totalMW = totalMW + 124
    console.log(`Generator #${currentGen} is on, adding 124 MW, for a total of ${totalMW} MW!`)
}
