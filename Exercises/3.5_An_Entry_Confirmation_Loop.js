// Video 3.1 accompanies this exercise

// Weâ€™ve learned to prompt the user for their age, and then confirm that their
// age has been entered correctly. Now we can use a while loop to improve the
// way this works.
//
// Create a while loop that will continue to execute as long as the user has
// not entered the correct age. Inside the loop, provide a confirmation that
// the age has been entered correctly:
//
//      "You entered <age>. Is this correct?"
//
// If that confirmation statement is correct, then set ageIsCorrect to true
// and alert the following message:
//
//      "Great! Your age is logged as <age>."
//
// Otherwise, the loop should continue to prompt a user to enter their age and
// assign that value to the userAge variable:
//
//      "What's your age, user?"
//
// Use the code below in your solution.

var userAge = prompt("What's your age, user?");
var ageIsCorrect = false;
