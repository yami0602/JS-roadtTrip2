// In the code below, morph the while loop
// into a for loop that uses the same variable names. Remember, you’ll still
// need to declare the starting number of goldfish and the number of months to
// print outside the loop. We’ve given you the starting number of goldfish
// again, as well as the amount of months you’ll need to print out for use in
// the loop parameters.

var numGoldfish = 4;
var monthsToPrint = 12;
let monthNumber = 2

// while(monthNumber <= monthsToPrint) {

//   numGoldfish *= 4;

//    console.log("There will be " + numGoldfish + " goldfish after " + monthNumber + " month(s)!");

//    monthNumber++;
// }



for(let monthNumber = 1; monthNumber <= monthsToPrint; monthNumber = monthNumber + 1) 
{
  numGoldfish *= 4;
  console.log("There will be " + numGoldfish + " goldfish after " + monthNumber + " month(s)!");
}
