// Video 2.1 accompanies this exercise

// In the code below, modify the while loop with a conditional that will
// only allow a number to be printed if it is even. Your results should be
// the even numbers from 10 to 2 in descending order. Think carefully about
// how your code might decide if a number is evenâ€¦
//
// Hint: Use the modulu operator.

var num = 10;

while (num > 0) {
  if(num % 2 === 0)
   console.log(num);

  num--;
}
