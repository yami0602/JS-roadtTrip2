// Video 3.1 accompanies this exercise

// With the userAge variable below, we can ensure that the user has entered
// their age correctly. Use a pop-up window function to confirm the user
// entry with the following message:
//
//      "You entered <age>. Is this correct?"
//
// Then store the result of the confirmation in a variable called ageIsCorrect.
// When you submit your code, enter your age in the prompt window, and then
// use the confirmation to select whether the entry is correct or incorrect.
// Lastly, log ageIsCorrect in the console to confirm its value.
//
// Note: You do not need any loops or conditionals to complete this challenge.

var userAge = prompt("What's your age, user?");
