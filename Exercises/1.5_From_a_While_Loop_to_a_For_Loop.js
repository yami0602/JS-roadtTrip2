// Video 1.4 accompanies this exercise

// Write a basic for loop that prints to the console all
// the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. This is the similar to one
// of the previous challenges, but this time weâ€™re using a for loop instead
// of a while loop.


let i = 10
while(i > 1) {
    console.log(`The while loop has run ${i} times.`)
    i--
}


for(let monthNumber = 10; monthNumber > 0; monthNumber = monthNumber - 1) {
    console.log(`The floor loop has run ${x} times.`)
}
